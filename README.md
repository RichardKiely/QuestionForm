# QuestionForm
complete question form using HTML CSS JS
This was a college project please see Requirements:
	At the bottom of each section a section summary should appear. 
	You should not be able to go to the next section until the previous is completed correctly.
	At the very end there should be a “Process” button which when clicked gives you a separate summary page which should contain a summary for each section and the overall final comment. 
	Your page should also include “help”. This can be done via mouseovers or clicks, for example when the user moves the mouse over the label corresponding to a question some text may appear in an otherwise hidden textarea explaining the question. The controls marked with a * need help.
	You also need to demonstrate 2 list boxes where the selection in the first populates the second. I will let this up to you to where it can be incorporated.
	There should be a visible timer on the page that gives the user 5 minutes to complete the form. After that a new page is loaded stating that your session expired with a link that allows the user to reload the form to start again.
	Your form should be properly formatted, aligned, responsive and intuitive to use. Marks will be allocated for this.
	Your code must include functions , arrays, validation, new elements displayed or created “on the fly”. 
	Where a value has been omitted on validation make sure the cursor moves to that element and the colour of the element is changed so it is evident to the user where the value is missing from.
